# Question 2(i)

# Define a function named calculate_bmi that takes a
# person's weight (in kilograms) and height (in 
# meters) as parameters and returns their BMI. (BMI = weight/height) 
# Calculate and sen their BMI category: 
# Below 18.5: "Underweight" 
# 18.5 to 24.9: "Normal weight" 
# 25 to 29.9: "Overweight" 
# 30 or above: "Obese"

    #BMI = (weight/height)
   # weight = ('In kilograms')
